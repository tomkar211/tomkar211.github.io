# Hello and Welcome.
This is my personal github repository. My name is Thomas and currently, i am a student at the [Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the University of Athens](https://www.di.uoa.gr/). I am mainly interested in computer architecture since I consider it to be one of the most important sectors in todays technology. It is fascinating how a digital system actually works and how from basic 0s and 1s we can create machines capable of astronomically hard tasks. I consider computers to be a way of describing our thoughts to something that has immense power. A humans logical thinking and a computers fast calculations are what have brought the world to its current technological state.
